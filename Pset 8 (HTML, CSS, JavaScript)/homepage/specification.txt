brief (one-sentence) description of how you chose to use JavaScript and Bootstrap:
    I used Bootstrap presets to (1) add breadcrumb to truthtable.html and poem.html and (2) style my buttons.
    I used JavaScript to (1) make the text blink in corridor.html and (2) ask the user a question in truthtable.html.
