        <h1>The University</h1>
        <h6>2021-03-31</h6>
        <p>
            last day of March. cloudless, blue, triumphant, maddening.
            the sun of spring, bright faced, shameless, scorch the rooms.
            people fill the streets like spilled beans. swinging pale legs.
            swank. saxophone blast. pigeons in flight, i in fright. eternity — the pavement.
            in front of McDonald's, a line expands/contracts. cokes and coffees, clank from hand to hand.
            the town, like a child, fresh from nightmare, shakes out irksome laughter.
            a good day for drugs, alas, malicious magic. i have none. the season of corruption has begun.
            the books? they must fend for themselves. libraries like dungeons.
            only the elevator gives no damn, cool and nonchalant, smelling of disinfectant.
            at home, a headless fly — i push open all the windows. promptly, rush of din,
            din from every corner, din from each municipal bin. meanwhile, a litter of coffee cups,
            floor unswept, plates in the sink. in short: the hot, evidently, is the enemy of dignity.
            what can i do! but draw the blinds, drop on the couch. sleep, spinoza, and three ice creams.
            wait for the tardy night to come, clean the palate, make me a fool. April is cruel.
